# Miniscuplter Current Execution State

## Release state
- stable: v1.0.32
- writable: v1.0.33
- release_freeze: false
- publication_active: false
- branch_bootstrap: complete; VERSION 1.0.33
- execution_hold: USER VERIFICATION REQUIRED

## Current objective
### F — verify the released v1.0.32 recovery checkpoint on the reference machine
- state: WAITING FOR USER REFERENCE-MACHINE EVIDENCE
- outcome: verify the v1.0.32 fixes against the Windows / GTX 1080 reference machine before assigning further product implementation or closing the affected issues
- release_evidence: v1.0.32 release-control publication completed successfully; tag, exact release candidate and installer/ZIP/hash assets were independently verified; validated forward branch v1.0.33 and VERSION 1.0.33 bootstrap completed, and the bootstrap exact-head build is green
- verify:
  1. MS-033 cancel an active 3D generation, then immediately generate again without restarting the app
  2. MS-036 successful 3D generation inserts directly without a redundant Apply step
  3. MS-037 generated exterior surfaces render correctly and neutral-gray shading makes surface detail readable
  4. MS-039 generated model rests on the grid at a sensible initial scale
  5. MS-040 Smart Select resolves and performs semantic selection without Not Found errors
  6. MS-035 ordinary window resize produces no black gutters and preserves the fixed side rails
  7. MS-026/MS-027 telemetry and AI command areas occupy their dedicated non-overlay bottom workspace
  8. MS-038 direct Move dragging works and Rotate exposes usable visible axis rings while precise axis controls remain functional
- acceptance: user/reference-machine evidence passes the above behaviors; failures are promoted/reopened in ISSUE_STATE and preempt new feature work as appropriate
- stop: Dev must not invent follow-on product scope while this verification gate is outstanding; any reproduced regression becomes the next implementation priority after Coordinator reconciliation
- continuation: after user evidence, Coordinator closes verified issues or routes failures; only then replenish the Dev queue

## Deferred / user-owned design
- MS-041 Refinement/Kitbash: structural direction is accepted, but exact UI/interaction design remains user-approval work after the released recovery checkpoint is verified.
- MS-042 Rig & Pose and Cleanup & Export remain intentionally later work.

## Architecture constraints
- Core remains durable-state and transform authority.
- Godot remains presentation/input authority.
- Python remains inference/geometry authority.
- Preserve local-first/storage containment, immutable revisions/stable IDs, transactional state/history and stale-result rejection.
